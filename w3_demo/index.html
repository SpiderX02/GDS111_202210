            <p class="text">My name is Freddy Santiago I was born and raised in Rhode Island, growing up, I was the youngest out of my siblings, I have 2 native languages: Spanish and English.
                I was wild when I was little till I discovered a game and console, Donkey Kong Country on the SNES. It helped me calm down, relax, aswell as developing not speech
                (as in speaking fluently) but thoughts and actions that I'm aware of meaning I had Hyper Active Disorder or I was just Hyper in general and I couldn't be able to
                control my actions, feelings, emotions and with that result I was put in a special eduacation class. I hated being in there ever since till I hit high school (kinda).
                I have a lot of favorite game and I can't really tell my top favorite but I can tell you two that seemingly close to that point which is Sonic Heroes and Kingdom Hearts.
                my biggest goal in life was to become rich and being able to take care of my family with that kind of money. therefore, I won't have any trouble using the money for my family.
                My other goal was to create the most ambitious, one of the most fun games I can make and I want know everything that relates to making a game. I enjoyed
                many different entertainments not just gaming, I enjoy TV shows, anime, movies, and reading comic books. I would share more but that's all I can think about, and I'm thinking
                of sharing my gaming projects someday in this class (when I feel confortmable if I'm honest). Welp, that's all folks.
